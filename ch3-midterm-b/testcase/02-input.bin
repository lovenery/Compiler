Basic Pizza Dough

Ingredients

3 cups all-purpose flour, divided as 1 3/4 cups and 1 1/4 cups
1 package active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup warm water
2 tablespoons canola oil or olive oil

Directions

In a large bowl, mix 1 3/4 cups flour with yeast and salt; add warm water and oil. Beat with a whisk for 3 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, stir in another 1 1/4 cups flour, or enough so mixture holds together. Place dough on a lightly floured surface. Knead in 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour - stop once it's lump-free. Wrap half the dough in plastic and freeze for later use; cover remainder and let it rest for about 10 minutes.
Heat oven to 425 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, divide dough into 4 portions and roll each into a 6-inch circle. Transfer to a greased baking sheet. Build up edges slightly; prick bottom of crusts. Bake about 8 minutes. Spread sauce and toppings onto crust and bake for another 8 minutes.
